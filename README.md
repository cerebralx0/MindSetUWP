# MindSetUWA
A NeuroSky MindWave &amp; MindWave Mobile EEG headset library for Windows 10 universal applications ecosystem. 
A part of my bachelor thesis at VÅ B - Technical University of Ostrava. Study year 2015-2016.

### General information
Library is designed primary for use with MindWave Mobile bluetooth headset paired with Windows 10 device. You can easilly recieve EEG readings to any UWA application and use them.
> However library also include a "legacy compatibility" for MindWave headsets that uses RF 2.4Ghz dongle. This legacy compatibility is limited to a devices that are capable to run ThinkGear connector software locally (So only Windows 10 for x86 desktop - this is due to a limitation to a ThinkGear software itself that only accepts packet connection from local device.)
