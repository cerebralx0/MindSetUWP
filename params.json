The library is specificaly designed to be very easy, fast and deployable with minimal changes and alterations of your already working code. With only 2  extra lines of code, your application can be ready to recieve and process users brainwave data. The library can not only work with real-time EEG readings, but also provides built-in data recording for long-term data analysis.\r\n\r\n### NeuroSky MindWave Mobile headset.\r\nLibrary is designet for use with Bluetooth equipped MindWave Mobile EEG headsets, that are the culmination of decades of EEG biosensor technology research—all in one easy-to-control, wearable package. As the most affordable brainwave-reading EEG headset available, the MindWave and MindWave Mobile transform science fiction into reality from the comfort of your living room.\r\n\r\n### Getting started.\r\nFirst, create a instance of MindSetConnection.\r\n```\r\nprivate MindSetConnection MyHeadset = new MindSetConnection()\r\n```\r\nAfter the MindSetConnection is created, we can directly proceed to connecting to  bluetooth EEG headset.\r\n```\r\nMyHeadset.ConnectBluetooth(\"MindWave Mobile\");\r\n```\r\nThats it ! We are all set and recieveing data from the headset. From now on , we can access all of the realtime reading directly from our instance od MindSetConnection, just like this :\r\n```\r\nDebug.Write(MyHeadset.RealtimeData.AlphaHigh); \r\nDebug.Write(MyHeadset.RealtimeData.Beta); \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
