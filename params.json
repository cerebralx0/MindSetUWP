{"name":"MindSetUWP","tagline":"NeuroSky MindWave Mobile EEG headset library for Windows Universal Platform (UWP)","body":"### Brainwave activity in your apps - with a blink of an eye.\r\nMindWaveUWP makes your universal Windows apps smarter and helps them to read user brainwave data using Bluetooth EEG sensors. The library is specifically designed to be very easy, fast and deployable with minimal changes and alterations of your already working code. With only 2 extra lines of code, your application can be ready to recieve and process users brainwave data. The library can not only work with real-time EEG readings, but also provides built-in data recording for long-term data analysis.\r\n\r\n### NeuroSky MindWave Mobile headset.\r\nLibrary is designed for use with Bluetooth equipped MindWave Mobile EEG headset. This device is the culmination of decades of EEG biosensor technology research—all in one easy-to-control, wearable package. As the most affordable brainwave-reading EEG headset available, the MindWave and MindWave Mobile transform science fiction into reality from the comfort of your living room.\r\n\r\n### Get - set - go\r\nFirst, we create a instance of MindSetConnection.\r\n```\r\nprivate MindSetConnection MyHeadset = new MindSetConnection()\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the MindSetConnection is created, we can directly proceed to connecting to EEG headset using the \"ConnectBluetooth\" method. We supply this method with the name of the bluetooth headset in string format. Please note, that this headset must be already paired with your device.\r\n```\r\nMyHeadset.ConnectBluetooth(\"MindWave Mobile\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's it, Sparky! We are all set and receiving data from the headset. From now on, we can access all of the realtime reading directly from our instance of MindSetConnection just like any other integer variable:\r\n```\r\nDebug.Write(MyHeadset.RealtimeData.AlphaHigh); \r\nDebug.Write(MyHeadset.RealtimeData.Beta); \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Getting advanced\r\nIt does not stop there because MindSetUWP library features much more. To learn all of the possibilities of the library from basic connecting, understanding EEG data to recording, events, emulation and exception manipulation.
